                Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) is a severe allergic reaction that can occur after an insect sting or after eating certain foods. The adverse reaction can be very fast, occurring within seconds or minutes of coming into contact with the substance the person is allergic to (allergen).
                </p>
                <p className="card-text">During anaphylactic shock, it may be difficult for the person to breathe, as their tongue and throat may swell, obstructing their airway.</p>
                <p className="card-text">Check if the person is carrying any medication. Some people who know they have severe allergies may carry an adrenaline self-injector, which is a type of pre-loaded syringe.
                You can either help the person administer their medication or, if you're trained to do so, give it to them yourself.</p>
                <p className="card-text">After the injection, continue to look after the person until medical help arrives. 
                All casualties who have had an intramuscular or subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of adrenaline must be seen and medically checked by a healthcare professional as soon as possible after the injection has been given. </p>
                <p className="card-text">Make sure they're comfortable and can breathe as best they can while waiting for medical help to arrive. If they're conscious, sitting upright is normally the best position for them.</p>
