                Poisoning is potentially life-threatening. Most cases of poisoning happen when a person has swallowed a toxic substance, such as bleach, taken an overdose of a prescription medication, or eaten wild plants and fungi. Alcohol poisoning can cause similar symptoms.
                </p>
                <p className="card-text">If you think someone has swallowed a poisonous substance, call an amublance to get immediate medical help and advice.</p>
                <p className="card-text">The effects of poisoning depend on the substance swallowed, but can include vomiting, loss of consciousness, pain or a burning sensation. The following advice is important:</p>
                <p className="card-text">Find out what's been swallowed, so you can tell the paramedic or doctor. </p>


                <p className="card-text">Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless a healthcare professional advises you to.</p>

                <p className="card-text">Do not try to cause vomiting.</p>

                <p className="card-text">Stay with the person, because their condition may get worse and they could become unconscious.
                </p>
                <p className="card-text">If the person becomes unconscious while you're waiting for help to arrive, check for breathing and, if necessary, perform CPR.</p>
                <p className="card-text">Don't perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the casualty's mouth or airway is contaminated with the poison.</p>
                <p className="card-text">Don't leave them if they're unconscious because they may roll onto their back, which could cause them to vomit. The vomit could then enter their lungs and make them choke.</p>
                <p className="card-text">If the casualty is conscious and breathing normally, put them into the recovery position and continue to monitor their conscious state and breathing.</p>
