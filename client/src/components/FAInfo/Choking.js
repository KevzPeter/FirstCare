                <p className="card-text">encourage the person to cough to try to clear the blockage ask them to try to spit out the object if it’s in their mouth don't put your fingers in their mouth to help them because they may accidentally bite you</p>

                <p className="card-text">If choking is severe, the person won’t be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe, and without help they’ll eventually become unconscious.</p>

                <p className="card-text">To help an adult or child over one year old:</p>

                <p className="card-text">Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with one hand. Lean the person forward so that the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down.
                Give up to five sharp blows between the person’s shoulder blades with the heel of your hand (the heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist).
                Check if the blockage has cleared.
                If not, give up to five abdominal thrusts (see below).
                </p>
                <p className="card-text">Abdominal thrusts shouldn't be used on babies under one year old, pregnant women or obese people.</p>
                <p className="card-text">To perform abdominal thrusts on a person who is severely choking and isn’t in one of the above groups:</p>
                <p className="card-text">Stand behind the person who is choking.
                Place your arms around their waist and bend them well forward.
                Clench one fist and place it just above the person's belly button.
                Place your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards.
                Repeat this up to five times.</p>
